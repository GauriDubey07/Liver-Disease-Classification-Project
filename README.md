Liver diseases are a major global health concern, often requiring early detection to prevent severe outcomes. This project aims to build a machine learning classification model to predict the presence and type of liver disease based on diagnostic data from blood and urine tests. By analyzing key medical indicators, the project seeks to provide an efficient and reliable decision-support tool for healthcare professionals.

Business Objective
The goal is to classify patients into one of the following categories:

No disease
Suspect disease
Hepatitis C
Fibrosis
Cirrhosis
This classification will help in identifying and addressing liver-related issues at an early stage.
